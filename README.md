### Slime Reagent
The slime reagent is the most basic way to determine if a chunk is slimy.
It can be crafted using gunpowder and redstone dust, a combination commonly known to react to slime presence.

After you crafted it, simply place it somewhere and wait some time to see if it reacts or not. The reagent is destroyed in the process.


### Slime Detector
Using slime reagent on every chunk to find one with slime presence can be time and ressource consuming. Happily, someone invented a little device that reacts to slime presence without consuming the slime reagent.
